/**
 * A wavelet transform method for arrays and signals of arbitrary lengths, even
 * odd lengths. The array is decomposed in several parts of optimal lengths by
 * applying the ancient Egyptian decomposition. Hereby, the array or signal is
 * decomposed to the largest possible sub arrays of two the power of p.
 * Afterwards each sub array is transformed forward and copied back to the
 * discrete position of the input array. The reverse transform applies the same
 * vice versa. In more detail the ancient Egyptian Multiplication can be easily
 * explained by the following example: 42 = 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^1 = 32 + 8 + 2.
 * However, an array or signal of odd length produces the smallest ancient
 * Egyptian multiplier 2^0 which is actually 1. Therefore, the matching sub
 * array or signal is untouched an the coefficient is actually the wavelet
 * coefficient of wavelet space of level 0. For an "orthonormal" wavelet this
 * holds. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_multiplication
